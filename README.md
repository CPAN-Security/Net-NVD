## Net::NVD

Perl interface to L<< NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD) | https://nvd.nist.gov/>>, allowing developers to search and retrieve CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) information.

```perl
    use Net::NVD;
    my $nvd = Net::NVD->new;

    # fetch a single CVE, by name.
    my $cve = $nvd->get( 'CVE-2019-1010218' );

    # search multiple CVE:
    my @cves = $nvd->search(
        keyword_search      => 'perl cpan',
        last_mod_start_date => '2023-01-15T13:00:00.000-03:00',
        no_rejected         => 1,
    );
```
